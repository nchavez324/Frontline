Simple Java Desktop Game

I started this game during the spring of my Junior year in high school while taking AP Computer Science.
Was a fun little experiment that introduced me to game programming and higher level programming concepts.
I learned a lot about the MVC paradigm (although its use was limited for a game) and threading and
event based programming. I also learned about asset utilization and optimization.

It's a (very) very simple top-down tile based shooter where you just use the WASD keys and the mouse to move
and shoot. I spent a lot of time on the graphics and the game logic behind the sprites, movement and bullets.
The tile collision isn't perfect, but it shouldn't be too frustrating!

I acutually submitted this as a supplement to a few colleges when applying to show them how much I wanted
to do Computer Science.

The project was done in Eclipse, back with Java SE 1.6.

All graphics and image assets are mine: I made all of them.
